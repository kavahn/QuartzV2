# Major Types of views 
- ### Multiview Projections
	- like the work sheets (just faces)
- ### Axonometric Projection
	- #### Isometric
		- angles a,b and c are jual
			- all edges are equal in length
	- #### Dimetric
		- Angles A and C are equal
			- those two edges are equal
	- #### Trimetric
		- No equal anything

- ### Oblique projection
	- there is at least 1 true face
		- the rest are scaled down
- ### Perspective 
	- (like us just moving around)
	- #### Terms
		- ###### Horizon line 
			- goes towards the vanishing point
			- is parralel with the ground line
		- ###### Ground line
			- the ground line
		- ###### Vanashing point
			- all lines converge to it
	- #### VP possition and number
		- ###### 1 point perspective 
			- 1 VP
		- ###### 2 point perspective 
			- 2 VP
		- ###### 3 point perspective 
			- 3 VP
- ### Parallel projection
	- it is the same as worksheet 1
	- #### we just have the observer at infinity and the face orthoganal to the LOS

# First Angle VS Third Angle Projections
- #### Third angle
	- US standard
- #### First Angle
	- european standard

# Language of lines
- ### Sketches use many lines
