# Definition
- #### A vector is a quantity with both a magnitude and a direction
	- ###### not to be confused with scalar that is only a magnitude

# Representations of a vector
- #### A vector $\vec{v}$ can be denoted by an arrow in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but we must denote its length as $|\vec{v}|$ (to show its direction and magnitude)
	- ###### vectors can be represented any where as long (we usually use the origin because its easy)
	- ###### In $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ its called an ordered pair 
	- ###### in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ its called a ordered triple
- #### vectors in $\mathbb{R}^{2},\mathbb{R}^{3}$
	- #### $\vec{v}=(a,b),\mathbb{R}^{2}$
	- #### $\vec{v}=(a,b,c), \mathbb{R}^{3}$
		- these numbers a b c are called components of the vector
		- the length of $\vec{v}$ can be found as just using Pythagoras
- #### position vector:
	- ###### The vector $\vec{v}$ is called the position vector of the point 
		- $P(a,b),\text{ or }P(a,b,c)$
# Special vectors
- #### The $\vec{0}$
	- ###### it is special because it has no direction
- #### Unit vector
	- ###### geometrically the unit vector is just the vector of 1 in any direction (this encodes the information of the vector)
- #### standard basis vectors
	- $\hat{i}=(0,0,1),\hat{j}=(0,1,0),\hat{k}=(1,0,0)$
		- same ones in physics

# Algebraic operations with vectors:
- #### Addition:
	- $\vec{u}+\vec{v}=(\vec{u}_{1}+\vec{v}_{1})+(\vec{u}_{2}+\vec{v}_{2})+(\vec{u}_{3}+\vec{v}_{3})\dots(\vec{u}_{n}+\vec{v}_{n})$
	- geometrically its just the A->C line

- #### Scalar multiplication
	- if c is a real number you can just extrude the vector 
- #### Difference
	- $\vec{u}-\vec{v}=\vec{u}+(-\vec{v})$
	- geometrically its similar to addition but we put the 2 initial positions together instead of stacking them
# Examples
#### How to find all possible values of a variable to be a unit vector
- ###### find all possible values of $\alpha$ to make $\vec{u}=\left( \frac{1}{4},-\frac{1}{2},\alpha \right)$
$$
\begin{align}
|\vec{u}|^{2}=1 \\
\left( \frac{1}{4} \right)^{2}+\left( -\frac{1}{2} \right)+\alpha^{2}=1
\end{align}
$$
