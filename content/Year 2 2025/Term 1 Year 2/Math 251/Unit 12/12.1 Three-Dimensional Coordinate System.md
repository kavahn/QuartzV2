# Summary
- #### 3d Coordinate system and sketch: 
	- points
	- surfaces
	- curves 
	- regions
		- ###### Geometry is a centerpiece of this course 
		- ######Sketching is a required skill and will be tested throughout this course
# Review
- ## Recall the 2D coordinate system
	- We must be consistent in our graphs image
		-  We can rotate the graph
			- ###### But we cant mirror it! (you could but you need to be consistent)
	- ### We can add a 3rd dimension by adding a line coming out of the intersection of the x-y plane
- ## Right hand rule
	- ![[12.1 Three-Dimensional Coordinate System-20240904155406238.png|372]]
		- where we curve our hands towards the y-axis
- ## Coordinates planes
	- #### We know the xy plane, but we can do this for all permutations of the varibles
		- ###### X-Y Plane
		- ###### X-Z Plane
		- ###### Y-Z Plane
	- #### Because of this we have octants like the quadrants of a 2d plane

# Coordinate systems in $\mathbb{R}^3$ 
- ## It is simple it follows (x,y,z)
	- this is self explanatory...
- ## Projection of points to coordinate planes and axes.
	- ###### If we are projecting onto a plane such as the xy plane we just take the xy coordinates and throwaway the rest 
		- this is similar to [[1.5 Projection]] 
		- *note* we dont get rid of the redundant coordinate we just enter a 0

# Sketching in $\mathbb{R}^3$
- ## if its a 2 varible function we can just sketch it but we need to extrude in the direction of the free varible
	- ###### Because the 3rd varible is a free varible so any value still would satisfy 
- #### EX.
	- $y^{2}+z^{2}=4$

# Distance formula
- #### The distance between two points $P_{1}(x,y,z)$ and $P_{2}(x,y,z)$ is 
	- $\mid P_{1}P_{2}|=\sqrt{ (x_{1}-x_{2})^{2}+(y_{1}-y_{2})^{2}+(z_{1}-z_{2})^{2} }$ 
		- this is derived because each point is perpidicular to each axis so they are sqares, we can just find the hypotunes
