# Under [[Nonlinear DES]] there are different types
- ### the fist order ODES are called separable equations

# Observation:
- #### any first order ODE$\frac{dy}{dx}=y(x,y)$ linear or non-linear, can always be multipliedby an arbiratary function

# Definition
- ### $\large M(x)+N(y){\frac{dy}{dx}}=0$
	- we can separate these from their varibles then entegrate both sides
