# What is [[Electric Flux]]
- #### Flux is induced thing when there is a plane perpendicular to an electric field
	- ###### $\phi=flux=EA\cos \theta$
	- ### More mathematical description 
		- When the E field is not constant we would need to 
			- $\phi_{s}=\int _{S}\vec{E}*{d\vec{A}} \, dx$
				-  $\phi_{s}$=Flux through surface S
				-  $\vec{E}*d\vec{A}=(EdA)\cos \theta$ , The $\vec{A}$ is the vector perpendicular to the Area
