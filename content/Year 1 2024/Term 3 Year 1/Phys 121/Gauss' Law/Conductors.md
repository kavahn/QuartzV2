# Building off [[Gauss' Law]]
- #### Static equilibrium
- ### Claim: E=0 inside any conductor at static equilibriuim
	- ###### charges in conductor move to make E field inside! 
		- and if E=/= 0 then charge feels force and moves
- ### Where is the force on an conductor
	- THERE IS NO TANGENTIAL force only the force normal to the area

## Conductors in silly situations
- #### A charge inside a hollow conductor
	- $$\begin{align}
R_{1}=inside-radius \\
R_{2}=Outside-radius \\
\end{align}$$![[Conductors-20240515170702669.png]]
