# What is a magnetic field/force
- its a field that magnets produce and moving current also produces it :)
- ### Magnetic field and force can be described by the definition
	- *$\vec{F}_{m}=q\vec{v}\times \vec{B}$*
		- where $\vec{B}$ is electric field
		- and $\vec{v}$ is velocity
	- To find $\vec{B}$ we can use (this is the [[Biot-Savart Law]])
		- $d\vec{B}=\frac{\mu_{0}I}{4\pi}\frac{d\vec{s}\times\hat{r}}{r^2}$

# Magnetic Force on a current
- ### Force on a moving charge is:
	- $\vec{F}_{m}=q\vec{v}\times \vec{B}$
		- But this doesnt really work for current as current is moving charges
			- We can see that all charges are defined as the Length times the current
	- $\vec{F}_{m}=IL$
- ### Force is indpendent of shape and current
	- we just try to find all the length then find the hight diffrence

		- *ALL* of the horizontal component doesn't matter *ONLY* the vertical (field has to be orthogonal)
- ### Force in a loop
	- if a current is in a loop in side a magnetic field the *FORCE IS 0*

			- if you add the in and out force it is zero but both of them make it spine because of the torque 
				- $\vec{\tau}=\vec{R}\times \vec{F}$
			- The torque is different
