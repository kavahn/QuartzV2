# What is the Biot-Savart Law
- it is a fundemental law for determining the direction and magnitude of the magnetic field due to an element of current
	- $d\vec{B}=\frac{\mu_{0}I}{4\pi}\frac{d\vec{s}\times\hat{r}}{r^2}$
- We can use this law to calculate the magnetic field produced by ANY current distribution But easy analytic calculations are possible only for a few distributions:
