# What is inductance 
- electric conductor or circuit that causes an electromotive force to be generated by a change in the current flowing. 
	- the magnetic field is proportional to the current in the loop
- #### we can find inductance through
$$
L \equiv \frac{\Phi_{B}}{I}
$$
- L is the self inductance and its equal to the ration of flux and current

# How to find inductance
- #### How to find emf 
	- $\epsilon=-L{\frac{dI}{dt}}$
- #### How to find inductance
	- $L \equiv \frac{\Phi_{B}}{I}$
		- inductance is in units of henry 
- #### How to find Magnetic field in solinoid
	- $B=\mu_{0}nI$
- #### How to find magnetic flux in solinoid
	- $\Phi_{B}=\mu_{0}n^{2}z\pi r^{2}I$
- #### How to find self inductance in the solinoid
	- $L=\mu_{0}n^{2}z\pi r^{2}$
