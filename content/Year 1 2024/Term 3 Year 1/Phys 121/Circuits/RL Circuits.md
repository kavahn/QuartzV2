# What is an inductor (building off [[Inductance]])
- #### LONG ASS SOLIDOID :rage: 
	- they can have energy stored in it :fear:

# How to the inductor impacts the circuit
- ### It stops current from traveling instantaneously
- #### to find current [[Kirchhoff's Rules]] are needed
	-  we would need to write out all of the components that effect the loop the inductor is in, 
		- we then get a differential equation that is almost the same as [[RC Circuit]]s 
- #### to find voltage
	- $V_{L}=L{\frac{dI}{dt}}$
