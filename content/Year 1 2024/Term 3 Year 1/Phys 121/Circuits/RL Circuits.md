# RL Circuits building off [[Inductance]]
- #### Overview
    - An RL (Resistor-Inductor) circuit contains both inductors and resistors.
    - These circuits are fundamental in understanding how the current changes when influenced by inductance and resistance.
- ### Inductors in a Circuit
    - Inductors oppose changes in current. When current changes, an electromotive force (emf) is induced.
    - The induced emf ($\varepsilon$) across an inductor is given by:
        - $\displaystyle \varepsilon = -L \frac{dI}{dt}$
        - Where $L$ is the inductance and $\frac{dI}{dt}$ is the rate of change of current.
- ### RL Circuit during Current Change
    - When an RL circuit is connected to a voltage source $V_0$ at $t=0$, the current through the inductor changes over time:
        - $\displaystyle I(t) = \frac{V_0}{R} \left(1 - e^{-\frac{R}{L}t}\right)$
        - Voltage across the Resistor: $\displaystyle V_R(t) = I(t)R = V_0 \left(1 - e^{-\frac{R}{L}t}\right)$
        - Voltage across the Inductor: $\displaystyle V_L(t) = V_0 e^{-\frac{R}{L}t}$
    - The time constant ($\tau$) of an RL circuit is defined as $\tau = \frac{L}{R}$, indicating how quickly the current reaches its maximum value.
- ### Example of RL Circuit during Current Change
    - #### Given:
        - Inductance: $L = 1\ \text{H}$
        - Resistance: $R = 10\ \Omega$
        - Voltage source: $V_0 = 5\ \text{V}$
    - #### Calculate:
        - Time constant ($\tau$): $\tau = \frac{L}{R} = \frac{1\ \text{H}}{10\ \Omega} = 0.1\ \text{sec}$
        - Current at $t = 0.2\ \text{sec}$: $I(t) = \frac{5\ \text{V}}{10\ \Omega} \left(1 - e^{-\frac{10}{1} \cdot 0.2}\right) = 0.5 \left(1 - e^{-2}\right)\ \text{A}$
- ### Discharging an Inductor
    - When the switch in an RL circuit is opened, the current through the circuit decreases exponentially.
    - The current and voltage at any time $t$ during discharging are given by:
        - $\displaystyle I(t) = I_0 e^{-\frac{R}{L}t}$
        - $\displaystyle V_L(t) = -L \frac{dI}{dt} = I_0 R e^{-\frac{R}{L}t}$
        - $I_0$ is the initial current at $t = 0$.
- ### Example of Discharging RL Circuit
    - #### Given:
        - Inductance: $L = 2\ \text{H}$
        - Resistance: $R = 5\ \Omega$
        - Initial current: $I_0 = 1\ \text{A}$
    - #### Calculate:
        - Time constant ($\tau$): $\tau = \frac{L}{R} = \frac{2\ \text{H}}{5\ \Omega} = 0.4\ \text{sec}$
        - Current at $t = 0.5\ \text{sec}$: $I(t) = 1\ \text{A} \times e^{-\frac{5}{2} \cdot 0.5} = e^{-1.25}\ \text{A}$
        - Voltage across inductor at $t = 0.5\ \text{sec}$: $V_L(t) = -L \frac{dI}{dt} = -2\ \text{H} \times \left(-\frac{5}{2} e^{-1.25}\ \text{A/sec} \right) = 5 e^{-1.25}\ \text{V}$`[1]``[2]``[3]`.
