# What is capacitance
- coloumb on plate holding until full then pissing onto other plate 

# Parrelel plate capacitor
- #### How can we find the electric field
	- $C=\frac{{\epsilon_{0}A}}{d}$ 
		- where A is area and d is distance between the two plates
	- $E={\frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_{0}}=\frac{Q}{\epsilon_{0}A}}$
	- $V=Ed$
