# Reflection and refraction 
- #### What is reflection and refraction
	- ###### When something hits a different medium than it is currently in it reflects and refracts
- #### An example and Equations 
	- ![[Reflection and Refraction-20240803005819823.png|430]]
	- ###### the angle of reflection is the same as the incoming angle
		- $\theta_{1}=\theta_{r}$
	- ###### Unlike sound (in air) the speed of light in matter is slower 
		- $v=\frac{c}{n}$ , Sn is the coefficient of the medium
	- ###### the equation dictating the path that the light takes is
		- Snell's Law: $n_{1}\sin \theta_{1}=n_{2}\sin \theta_{2}$
	- ###### The critical angle is when there is total internal reflection
		- $\theta_{c}=\sin^{-1}\left( \frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}} \right)$
	- ###### Brewster's angle 
		- $\tan \theta_{1}=\frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}}$
- #### Total internal reflection
	- ###### is as the name suggests when the light beam is trapped in the medium and cannot escape

		- when the angle of incidence equals the critical angle $\theta_{c}:$ 
			- $n_{1}\sin \theta_{c}=n_{2}\sin90\degree$ 
			- $\theta_{c}=\sin^{-1}\left( \frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}} \right)$
		- ###### When the angle of incidence exceeds $\theta_{c}$ total internal reflection occurs.
