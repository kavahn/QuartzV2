# What is electromagnetic waves
- #### They are a wave that both has a [[Electric Fields]] and [[Magnetism]] wave
	- much like these these wave dont need a medium to travel in
		- they are created because a changing electric field induses a magnetic field which induces an electric field like a chain reaction
			- the velocity of these waves are the speed of light C
