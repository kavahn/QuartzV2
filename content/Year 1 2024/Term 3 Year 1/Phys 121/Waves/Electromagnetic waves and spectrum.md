# What is electromagnetic waves
- #### They are a wave that both has a [[Electric Fields]] and [[Magnetism]] wave
	- much like these these wave dont need a medium to travel in
		- they are created because a changing electric field induses a magnetic field which induces an electric field like a chain reaction
			- the velocity of these waves are the speed of light C

# Electromagnetic Waves 
- #### Equation describing Harmonic waves
	- ![[Electromagnetic waves and spectrum-20240803080745730.png|432]]
	- $E_{x}=E_{0}\cos(kz-wt)$
	- $B_{y}=\frac{k}{w}E_{0}\cos(kz-wt)$
