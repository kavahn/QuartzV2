# Interference
- #### one type of interference is diffraction
	- ###### Diffraction is the bending or spreading out of a wave around obstacles
- ### More commonly with the wave equation $\begin{align} E_{1}=E_{0}\cos(wt+\phi_{1})\\E_{2}=E_{0}\cos(wt+\phi_{2})\\\text{phase difference:}\Delta \phi=\phi_{2}-\phi_{1}\end{align}$
	- #### Constructive
		- adding 2 waves amplify each other
			- $\Delta \phi=0,2\pi,4\pi\dots$
	- #### Destructive 
		- adding 2 waves destroy each other 
			- $\Delta \phi=\pi,3\pi,5\boldsymbol{\pi}..$
	- ###### They can be true at the same time! (partially destructive interference)
# Huygens' Principle
- ### Definition
	- ###### Every point on a wave front acts as a point source
		- the wave front as it develops is tangent to all the wavelets 
			- basically we can take a wave, an the subsect it into many tiny wavelets

# interference (double-slit)
- ### If light is a wave there should be an interference pattern! 
	- ###### we are ignoring wave-particle duality rn
- #### The young's double-slit experiment
	- ###### the interference occurs because each point on the screen is not the same distance from both slits!
		- depending on the path length difference the wave can act differently

	- #### Constructive: $d\sin \theta=m\lambda,\text{   } m=0,1,2,\dots$
	- #### Destructive: $d\sin \theta=\left( m+\frac{1}{2} \right),m=0,1,2,\dots$
- ## Intensity in the double-slit

# Interference in Thin films
- #### Another way path lengths can differ, and waves interfere
	- is if they travel through diffrent media. if there is a very thin film of material (a few wavelengths thick)
		- light will reflect both at the bottom and the top of the layer

- ### Interference in thin films 
	- #### Wave length in medium = $\frac{\lambda}{n}$
- #### A similar effect is when a shallowly curved piece of glass is placed on a flat one
	- when viewed from above concentric circles appear that are called newton's rings

	- ###### When $n_{2}>n_{1}$, the phase changes by $180^o$ $\left( \frac{\lambda}{2} \right)$ upon reflection
