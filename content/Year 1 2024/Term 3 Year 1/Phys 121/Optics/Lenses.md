# Thin Lenses 
- #### What are thin lenses
	- they are lenses that are thin :exploede: 
		- they have a focal point on each side 
		- they have a focal length to each focal point
- ## Lens Formula 
$$\large\frac{1}{f}=\frac{1}{d_{0}}+\frac{1}{d_{i}}$$
- ## Types of Lenses
	- #### Convex (Converging)
		- ###### they take the image and make it converge onto the focal point
			- the focal length is *always* positive
	- #### Concave (Diverging) 
		- ###### They take the image and
