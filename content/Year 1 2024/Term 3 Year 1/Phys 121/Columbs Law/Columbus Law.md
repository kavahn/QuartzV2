## Electric Charges
- ### Charge is quantized
	- 1 e = 1.60 x 10-19 C
	- ###### Charges are conserved but can be transferred between objects
- ### Charges effect other charges
	- The force on a charge to charge is proportional to the product of the charges and inversely to the distance squared
- Electric Charges in an Atom In an atom, there are electrons, protons and neutrons. An electron is negatively charged, while a proton is positively charged. Neutrons are uncharged.
