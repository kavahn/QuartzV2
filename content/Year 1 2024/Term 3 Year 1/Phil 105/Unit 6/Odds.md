=# What are odds
- they are odds lol
# BRO THIS IS JUST [[Combinatorics]] 
- #### THIS IS PHIL???

# Conditional Probability
- ###### Instead of using a if we can use given
	- ###### Chance of A = $P(A)$
		- $P(A|B)$ => Chance of A given B
- #### Ex
	- ###### Shark death prob
		- Originally we had $P(SD|p)$ SD being shark death, and p is population => $\frac{6}{8000000000}$, this isnt too accurate as the only people who do get attacked are surfers
			- $P(SD|SF)$, this increases our odds
				- then if we inverse the probibility $P(SF|SD)$ is really high as majority of SD peolpe are surfers

# Dis-junction
- #### What does this means
	- this connects back to [[AA and DC operators]]
- #### When 

# Conjunction
- #### When any two things happen in a row you multiply the chances together
