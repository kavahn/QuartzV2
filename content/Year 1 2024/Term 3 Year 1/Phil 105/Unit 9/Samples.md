# What is a Sample

- #### A sample is a subset of a larger population of items.
    
    - Used to make inferences about the population without examining every item.
    - The goal is to generalize from sample data to population characteristics.

# Generalizing from a Sample

- #### Generalization Argument Pattern:
    
    - N% of [Sample] has [Feature].
    - N% of [Population] has [Feature].
    - Example:
        - 30% of pregnancies at Gotham General Hospital (GGH) with women aged 20-24 are unplanned.
        - Therefore, 30% of pregnancies in women aged 20-24 in Gotham are unplanned.
    - Population: pregnancies in women aged 20-24 in Gotham.
    - Sample: pregnancies in women aged 20-24 at GGH.
    - Feature: unplanned`[1]``[2]`.

# Sample Size and Its Impact

- #### Importance of Sample Size:
    
    - Larger sample sizes generally provide more reliable generalizations.
    - Sample size is indicated with ( n ).
    - Example:
        - 30% of pregnancies at GGH with women aged 20-24 (n=500) are unplanned.
        - Therefore, 30% of pregnancies in women aged 20-24 in Gotham are unplanned`[3]`.

# Precision and Accuracy

- #### Understanding Precision vs. Accuracy:
    
    - **Precision**: Exactness or specificity of a statement.
    - **Accuracy**: Closeness of a statement to the truth.
    - Example:
        - Precise statements: "The speed of light is 155,286,903 m/s" and "The speed of light is 271,306,682 m/s."
        - Accurate statement: "The speed of light is around 300,000,000 m/s" (true value: 299,792,458 m/s)`[4]``[5]`.

# Margin of Error and Confidence Level

- #### Defining Margin of Error (MoE):
    
    - Quantifies the precision of a statistical estimate.
    - Presented as a range (e.g., ±4 points).
    - Larger MoE indicates lower precision.
    - Confidence level indicates the likelihood that the true population parameter lies within the MoE.
    - Example:
        - At GGH, 30% of pregnancies with women aged 20-24 (n=500) are unplanned (±4 pts).
        - Indicates a confidence level, typically 95% if not stated`[6]`.

# Identifying Sample Bias

- #### Understanding Sample Bias:
    
    - A biased sample occurs when some characteristic of the sample makes the measured feature more (or less) common than in the entire population.
    - **Examples of Bias**:
        - Argument that 60% of the cities visited by airplane have a university implies that 60% of all cities have a university. This is biased due to the selection of cities with airports`[7]``[8]`.

# Unit 9 Skills

- #### Key Skills to Develop:
    
    - Recognizing how changes in precision, MoE, confidence level, or sample size affect one another.
    - Evaluating the effect of sample size on the strength of an argument.
    - Identifying and explaining sample bias`[9]`.
