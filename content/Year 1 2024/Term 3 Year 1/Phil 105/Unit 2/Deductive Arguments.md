# What is an Argument
- #### it is a set of statements that has a 
	- Premise + Premise = Conclusion
	- the premise must be true so that the conclusion is true
# What is a Deductive Argument
- #### It is Valid
	- #### Valid Arguments
		- if a argument is valid
			- it has to have the truth preserved  
		- However arguments can be invalid even if the premise is true 
			- but the conclusion is false
	- #### Thats a true statement => that's a valid argument
	- #### Some arguments look valid but are not
		- All A are B
			- X is a B
			- X is an A (NOT TRUE) because As are in the set of Bs, Bs are bigger than As therefore the argument is invalid
- ### Example
	- ###### Alsl A are B
		- x is an A
			- => X is a A and B
	- ###### No A are B
		- x is an A
			- => X is not a B
