# What is SVD
- #### Recall that A is orthoganally diagonalizable if there existsa n orthoganal matrix P and digonal  matrix D
	- $P^{T}AP=D$ this is just [[6.2 Diagonalization]]
	- what if we allow othogonal matrices U and V to be used in "diogonalization" instead of P
		- $A=U\Sigma V^T$ 

# How to find SVD
- #### To find the values of V and $\Sigma$
	- we must do $A^{T}A$
		- this simlifies to $V\Sigma^{T}\Sigma V^{T}$
			- since $\Sigma^{T}\Sigma=\Sigma^{2}$ is a diagonal matrix, this tells us that $A^{T}A$ needs to be orthoganally diagonalied with
				- $P=V,D=\Sigma^2$
