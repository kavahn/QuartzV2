# What is Orthogonal Diagonalization
- #### Remember that in [[7.1 Orthogonal and orthonormal bases]] an orthogonal matrix is an nxn matrix whose columns form an orthonormal basis for $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
	- ##### From [[6.2 Diagonalization]]
	- ###### A is similar to B if there exists a matrix P such that $P^{-1}AP=B$
	- ###### A is diagonalizable if it is similar to a diagonal matrix D.
- ##### Suppose we want P to be an orthogonal matrix, not just any invertible matrix this give rise to the following definition
- #### Definition
	- ###### We say that two nxn matrices A and B are orthogonally similar if there exists an orthogonal matrix P such that $P^{T}AP=B$ 
		- we say that A is orthogonally diagonalizable if A is similar to diagonal matrix D. that is there exists an orthogonal matrix P and diagonal matrix D such that: 
$$
P^{T}AP=D
$$
# When is a matrix orthogonally diagonalizable? 
- ### Let $A$ be matrix ok! to know if a matirx is orthoganlly diagonalizable, we must find if the dot products of the eigenspace is 0

# How to orthogonally diagonalize
- #### Its less about how to do it, but what the relation ship looks like to the vector
	- ###### You might be asked to find $P^{T}AP=D$ or in the terms of $A=PDP^{T}$
