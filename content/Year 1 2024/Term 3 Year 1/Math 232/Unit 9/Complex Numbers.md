- # What are complex numbers
	-  recall in Eulers thesis (or what ever the fuck it was called)
		- we denote $\sqrt{ -1 }=i$ 
			- same rules as regualar algebra apply to it
- #### A complex number is a number of the form $a+bi,(a,b\in\mathbb{R})$ 
	- a is the *Real* part of them number
	- b is the *imaginary part*
		- complex is $\mathbb{C}$ where as reals are $\mathbb{R}$ 
- #### $\sqrt{  }$ dont really work as $\sqrt{ ab }=/=\sqrt{ a }\sqrt{ b }$

# Solving polynomials with complex numbers
- #### For $n>0$ we say $\sqrt{ -n }=(\sqrt{ n })i$

# Other properties of complex numbers
- #### if $z=a+bi$ is a complex number, then we define the *absolute value* or the modulus of z as $|z|=\sqrt{ a^{2}+b^{2} }$ and the conjugate of z as $\bar{z}=a-bi$ 
	- ###### properties:
		- $\bar{z}=z$ if and only if $z\in\mathbb{R}$
		- $\bar{z_{1}\pm z_{2}}=\bar{z_{1}}\pm \bar{z_{2}}$
		- $\bar{z_{1}z_{2}}=\bar{z_{1}}*\bar{z_{2}}$
		- for any interger, n, $\bar{z^{n}}=\bar{z}^n$
		- $\bar{z}z=|z|^2$

# sketching complex numbers in the complex plane
- #### A complex number $a+bi$ can be drawn like the vector $(a,b)$ in the $xy-plane$ 
# Examples
- #### Solving polynomial
	- ###### $z^2-2z+2=0$
		- recall: $az^{2}+bz+c=0$
$$
\begin{align}
z^{2}-2z+2=0 \\
z=\frac{2\pm \sqrt{ 4-8 }}{2} \\
\implies z_{1}=1+i \\
\implies z_{2}=1-i
\end{align}
$$
- Note: every poly nomial over $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{C}$ can be factored into linear factors in $\mathbb{C}$ ([[Fundamental Theorem of Algebra]])
