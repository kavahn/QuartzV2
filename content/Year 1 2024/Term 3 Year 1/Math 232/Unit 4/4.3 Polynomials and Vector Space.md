# What does poly nomials have to do with vector space 
- ###### In [[4.1 Vector Spaces]] we saw that we can solve variables other than x in a system of equations
- #### What does this mean
	- ###### Poly nomials are vector spaces
		- any vector in a vector space is "equivalent" to a vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$ 
			- this acts as the coordinates for the standard basis of the vector space
