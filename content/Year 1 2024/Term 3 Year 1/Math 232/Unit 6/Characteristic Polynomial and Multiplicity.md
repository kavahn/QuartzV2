# What is the characteristic polynomial
- #### IT IS 
	- $\det(A-\lambda I)$

# What is algebraic multiplicity
- #### Let $\lambda_{i}$ be an eigen value of A. 
	- the algebraic multiplicity of $\lambda_{i}$ is the number of times the factor of $\lambda-\lambda_{i}$ shows up in the factored formo f the characteristic polynomial
