# What is Diagonalization
- ###### Recall from section [[4.6]] the formula:
	- $[L]_{B}=P_{S\to B}[L]P_{B\to S}=P^{-1}[L]P$
	- this is one of the motivations form "similar matrices".
- ### Defininition
	- ###### Let A and B be nxn matrices. A is similar to B if there exsts a matrix $P$ such that $P^{-1}AP=B$ 
		- basicly just changing the matrice to a diffrent basis 

# Properties of Diagonalization
- #### Similar matrices have the same 
	- ###### Determinant
		- so we can just diagonalize to get the determinant easily 
	- ###### Eigenvalues
	- ###### Rank
- #### An nxn matrix A is **Diagonalizable** if A is similar to a diagonal matrix that is:
	- $P^{-1}AP=D$

# When is a matrix diagonalizable
- #### An nxn matrix A is diagonalizable if and only if there is a basis consisting of n linearly independent eigenvectors of A.
	- it is only diagonizable if theer is the same amount of eigen values as collumns/rows
