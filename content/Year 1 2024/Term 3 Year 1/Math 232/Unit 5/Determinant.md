	- ###### 3x3 
	- #### Bigger than 3x3 
		- in general, let A be a nxn matrix with $n\geq 3$ and let $A(i,j)$ denote the $(n-1)(n-1)$ sub matrix of A with the $ith$ row and $jth$ column removed. th

			-  this is just showing that we must multiply the original cross man
		- we must make it + - + - for adding the guys and it goes on like that pattern like a checkerboard for the entire matrix
- ### We can just adjust the starting the det row/column 
	- by just changing the start line to the one with the most 0 entries but we must adhere to the checkerboard

# Properties of determinants:
- the determinant of an upper-traigular, lower-triangular, or diagonal matrix is the product of the diagonal entries.
- 

# Example 
- #### More than 3x3 
	- its just the cross but you get the matrix size down, then you keep doing it until you get a 2x2 matrix :/
