# Length of a vector
- #### The length of a vector is defined as 
	- $\mid\mid(x_{1},x_{2},\dots,x_{n})\mid\mid=\sqrt{ x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+\dots+ x_{n}^{2} }$

# The dot product
- ### What is the Dot product
	- let $\vec{u}=(u_{1},u_{2},\dots,u_{n})$ and $\vec{v}=(v_{1},v_{2},\dots,v_{n})$ be two vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ the dot product of $\vec{u},\vec{v}$ is defined as 
		- $\vec{u}\cdot \vec{v}=u_{1}v_{1},u_{2}v_{2}+\dots+u_{n}v_{n}$
	- ###### Loosly, the dot product is a measure of how much one vector is "towards the directon" or the otheroq
- #### If two vectors dot product is 0 they are orthogonal
	- $\vec{u}*\vec{v}=0$ they are perpendicular 
- #### EX
	- finding all vectors $\vec{v}$ that are orthoganal to both $(1,0,2),and(1,2,3)$
		-  Need a $\vec{v}=(a,b,c)$ that 
$$
\begin{align}
a+0b+2c=0 \\
a+2b+3c=0
\end{align} \implies\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\
1 & 2 & 3 & 0
\end{bmatrix}\to RREF\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 1/2 & 0
\end{bmatrix} \therefore a=-2t,b=-\frac{1}{2}b
$$
