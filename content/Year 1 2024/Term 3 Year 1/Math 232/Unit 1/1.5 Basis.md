# What is a basis
- basis are when a set of vectors are linearly independent in the [[1.4 Subspace]] 
- #### EX
	- (1,1) is a basis for $S_{1}=span(1.1)$
		- another basis is $(2,2)$ 
	- (1,2), (3,6) is not a basis for the $span((1,2),(3,6))$ because they are linearly dependent 
	- ###### Show from the definition that
