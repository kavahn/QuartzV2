# What is a Subspace
- we know from [[1.2 Span]] if a span is a line it would be a line in the $\mathbb{R}^n$ 
	- and to get a subspace it has to span an area and has to be linearly independent from one another
	- #### a subspace can be thought of as a 'line/plane' that passes through the origen
		- ###### intuitively: a subspace is a span of some vectors
- #### the formal definition
	- ###### it is a set of vectors in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ which is closed under linear combinations
		- (where if you take all possible linear combitinations we get the same set of numbers)
- #### We can show that somthing isnt a subspace using [[Counterexamples]]

## Examples
#### Ex1
$$
S=(\begin{bmatrix}
2t \\
t
\end{bmatrix}|t\in\mathbb{R})
				$$
- is a subpsace of $\mathbb{R}^2$ because
$$
let\begin{bmatrix}
2t_1 \\
t_1
\end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix}
2t_2 \\
t_2
\end{bmatrix}\in \mathbb{R}
$$
- then 
#### Ex2
$$
S=([x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}]|x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}=0)
$$
- is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^3$, because
