# What is the method of least squares
- #### remember how in [[7.2 Projection onto subspaces and Gram-Schmidt]] that a projection of x onto W 
	- ###### represents the point on W that is the closest to x

	- ###### We can see this as the same way if a vector is inconsistent and we need the solution so we can just find the solution closest to the orignal vector
- #### Any $\vec{x}$ which is a solution to $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}_{0}$ is the closest in minimizing the least squares error, we call such a solution a best fit solution or a least squares error solution

# Finding the best-fit solution to $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$
- #### it is possible to find the best-fit solution to an inconsistent system $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$ without finding $\vec{b}_{0}$ by projection
	- ###### recall that row(A) and null(A) are "orthogonal to eachother". that is:
		- $Null(A)=(Row(A))^\perp$ 
	- ###### similarly
		- $Null(A^T)=(Row(A^{T}))^{\perp}=Col(A)^T$ 
	- ###### Since the perp part $\vec{b}-\vec{b}_{0}$ is orthogonal to Col(A), $\vec{b}-\vec{b}_{0}$ is in $Null(A^T)$ so we can write
		- $A^{T}(\vec{b}-\vec{b}_{0})=\vec{0}<=> A^{T}\vec{b}_{0}=A^{T}\vec{b}$ 
		- ###### And replacing $\vec{b}_{0}=A\vec{x}$
			- $A^{T}A\vec{x}=A^{T}\vec{b}$
