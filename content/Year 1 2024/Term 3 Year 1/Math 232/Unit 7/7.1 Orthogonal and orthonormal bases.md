- #### a set of vectors $[\vec{v}_{1},\vec{v}_{2},\dots,\vec{v}_{k}]$is called an orthogonal set if $\vec{v}_{i}\cdot \vec{v}_{j}=0$ for every $i=/=j$ 
	- if in addition each $\mid \mid \vec{v}_{i}\mid\mid=1$ (each vector has length 1) the set is called an orthonormal set
- ## Basically each dot product pair needs to equal zero 

# what is an orthogonal set
- #### a set of vectors $[\vec{v}_{1},\vec{v}_{2},\dots,\vec{v}_{k}]$is called an orthogonal set if $\vec{v}_{i}\cdot \vec{v}_{j}=0$ for every $i=/=j$ 
	- if in addition each $\mid \mid \vec{v}_{i}\mid\mid=1$ (each vector has length 1) the set is called an orthonormal setup
- ## Basicly each dot product pair needs to equal zero 

- #### AN orthogonal set is *always* a linearly independent set
	- so if an orthogonal set B spans a subspace W, we say that B is an orthogonal basis for W.
	- similarly, an orthonormal set that spans W is called an orthonoramal basis for W.

# Standard basis is an orthonormal basis for $\mathbb{R}^n$ 
- #### the standard basis $[\vec{e}_{1},\vec{e}_{2},\dots,\vec{e}_{n}]$ is an orthonormal basis for $\mathbb{R}^n$
	- ###### we can convert non orthonormal basis to an orthonormal basis 
		- by dividing the each vector component by the length of it
