# Final Review for [[Phys 120]]

### Question 1 [[Angular Momentum]]
- ![[Review-20240418201559984.webp|541]]
- ###### The one question about throwing a ball at the pins
	- we are ignoring gravity
		- we are assuming that we are spinning the pin about the center of mass
			- like if the ball is force adding adding to it
	- ###### 2 things are conservered
		- linear momentum $\vec{p}$
			- we know that $\vec{p}_{i}=\vec{p}_{f}$
				- => $m_{b}\vec{v}_{bi}=m_{a}\vec{v}_{o}+m_{b}\vec{v}_{bf}$$(0.603kg)(12.8m/s)=(0.383kg)\vec{v}_{o}+(0.453kg)(5.0m/s)$
		- angular momentum $\vec{L}$
			- we know that $\vec{L}_{i}=\vec{L}_{f}$
				- $\vec{r}\times \vec{p}_{i}=\vec{r}\times \vec{p}_{f}+\vec{L}_{o}$
					- $|\vec{r}\times \vec{p}_{i}|=rmv_{i}\sin \theta\implies mv_{i}d$
						- d is the height of the ball hiting the center of mass
					- $mv_{bi}d=mv_{bf}d+I_{o}w_{o}$
						- we are adding I and W because we start with a initial velocity and we will end with a *spinning* object and a moving object so it "split"

### Question 2 [[parallel axis theorem]]
- lecture 20 i cliccer question
	- sphere: $I_{cm}=\frac{2}{3}MR^2$
	- rod $I_{r}=\frac{1}{3}ML^{3}$
	- $I_{tot}=I_{r}+I_{s}$ we know what $I_{r}$ is not $I_{s}$
		- $I_{s}=I_{cm}+ML^{2}$
			- => $I_{s}=\frac{2}{5}MR^{2}+ML^{2}$
				- $I_{tot}=\frac{1}{3}ML^{2}+\frac{2}{3}MR^{2}+ML^{2}$

### Question 3 [[Precession]]

### Question 4 that one question on SHM part 2 b
- Question 1
	- A 2,671 g mass is hung on a "massless" vertical spring with a spring constant of k = 330 N/m. The mass is pulled down and released such that it undergoes simple harmonic motion with an amplitude of 10.0 cm. 
	- a) What is the spring potential energy of the system in Joules when the mass is located 6.7 cm below the equilibrium position (about which the mass oscillates)? 
- ###### solve
	- we know its in eq $kx=mg\to x=\frac{mg}{k}$
		- $U_{s}=\frac{1}{2}k(x+d)^{2}$
- Question 2
	- The mass in part a) is now removed and a new 376 g mass is hung from the same spring (k = 330 N/m). This new mass is pulled down 7.60 cm below the equilibrium position and released. It starts undergoing simple harmonic motion. 
	- b) Find the velocity of the mass in m/s at t = 7.3 s. If the mass is moving upwards the velocity should be positive and if it is moving downwards the velocity should be negative. 
- ###### solve
	- we know that d=A because how ever you pull it down it will go back that amount
